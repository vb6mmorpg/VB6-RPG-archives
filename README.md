# VB6 Online RPG Games Archive

This Repo is a archive of all the opensource Visual Basic 6 online RPGs I could find code for.

If you happen to have code for one I don't have listed then please let me know.

I don't own any of the code listed in this repo I am just archiving it since most of it is now no longer online or hard to find online.


I will slowly be uploading all the backups I have from all the sites I got them from which most are now gone.

Some archives will be split since github only allows a certin file size
